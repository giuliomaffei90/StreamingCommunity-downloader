# ── Stream resolution ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# There is one road to a playlist: the source's iframe, then the vixcloud embed
# page. When Cloudflare answers that page with a challenge the scraper cannot
# clear, every download of that title stops.
#
# A second road was built through vixsrc.to, which serves the same streams keyed
# by TMDB id — an id the title page hands us for free. It was removed again
# after testing: vixsrc is now a client-rendered Next.js app whose HTML carries
# no playlist, no token and no .m3u8 at all, so the data would have to come from
# reverse-engineered internal calls that break silently on any of their deploys.
#
# What is left is the seam. resolve_stream() is where a fallback plugs in, the
# resolution context (tmdb_id, media type, season, episode) is already threaded
# from every caller, and fetch_key_from_playlist() can read a key from a
# playlist that does not put it where vixcloud does. Adding a provider means
# writing one function and listing it below.

# Hosts a playlist may name as the source of its AES key. The playlist is
# published by the stream page, so an unconstrained URI would have the panel
# fetching whatever that page asked it to.
_KEY_HOSTS = ("vixcloud.co",)

# Fallback providers, tried in order when the primary fails. Each takes
# (tmdb_id, media_type, season, episode) and returns a StreamSource.
#
# Empty: with none registered, resolve_stream() re-raises the primary failure
# unchanged, which is exactly the behaviour the panel had before any of this.
