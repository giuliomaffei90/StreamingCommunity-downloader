"""Finding the source domain again after it rotates.

The source's domain changes every few weeks. Until now that meant the panel
simply stopped working: searches failed, nothing said why, and an administrator
had to go and find the new address themselves.

A third-party page publishes the current one. This module reads it, checks the
candidate is plausible, proves it actually serves the source, and — by default —
*proposes* it rather than adopting it. That default is the whole design. The
page is editable by people we do not control, and the domain is not a cosmetic
setting: every search, every image fetch and every download referer goes to
whatever host is configured here. Adopting one because a web page said so, with
nobody looking, hands a stranger the ability to point this panel wherever they
like. `domain_auto_apply` exists for deployments that want it anyway, and is off
unless asked for.

The candidate is held in memory, not in data.json. It is discovery state, not
configuration, and a candidate frozen across a restart could be applied long
after the page it came from had changed again.
