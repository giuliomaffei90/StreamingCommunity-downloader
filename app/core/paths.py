"""Destination paths for downloaded media.

Extracted from film.py, tv.py and animeunity.py, which each built the same
layout inline. The request system has to know where a download *would* land in
order to check whether it is already in the library, and a second copy of that
logic would silently drift from the downloader's.

The names themselves come from templates now (see app/core/naming.py), but the
three signatures here are unchanged: they are the shared contract with
``resolver.destination_path()``, and that agreement is the whole reason this
module exists. ``templates=`` is the one addition, and it is what lets the
library check ask "where would this have landed under the *old* layout?" without
a second implementation of any of it.
